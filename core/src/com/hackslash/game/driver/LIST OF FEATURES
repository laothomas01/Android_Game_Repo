code refactoring:

controller classes:
[] move toward object functions

BUGS:
[] cannot increase firerate due to the program being too fast when removing arraylist of bullet objects
[] first enemy that collides with a bullet doesnt immediately get removed.
Future refactor thoughts:
[] check how long the player has not detected the current enemy it is suppose to see. if enemy not seen for X number of seconds, remove from linkedlist and replace with new incoming enemy
[] object collision function should be part of object controller class, not object model.
