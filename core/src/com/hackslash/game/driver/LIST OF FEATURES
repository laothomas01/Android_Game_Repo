other artsy fartys stuff:
[] better sprites
[] audio
Testing:
   [] add sliders so you can play with in-game values.
code refactoring:
[] fired bullets at enemies should not home on enemies. should fly in a direction towards the enemy's position???
[] there are 2 ways to approach refactoring the Game_Object class's hasCollided function
    1) we migrate all that code into an object_controller
    2) we stick with the Game_Object class.
        -refactoring this function means only needing to pass in 1 parameter rather than 2. it is important than that the passed in game object for the
        function's collision detection must be explicit. If a player object is using the hasCollided funcition,
        you would use a THIS keyword to utilize data within the current game object and then check for collision with the parameter's
        game object.

BUGS:
[] cannot decrease fire cool down without causing a concurrency modification error. bullets get removed faster than loaded.
[] first enemy that collides with a bullet doesnt immediately get removed.
Future refactor thoughts:
[] check how long the player has not detected the current enemy it is suppose to see. if enemy not seen for X number of seconds, remove from linkedlist and replace with new incoming enemy
[] object collision function should be part of object controller class, not object model.
