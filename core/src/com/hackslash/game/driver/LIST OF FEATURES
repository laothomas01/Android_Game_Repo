code refactoring:
[] fired bullets at enemies should not home on enemies. should fly in a direction towards the enemy's position???
controller classes:
[] move toward object functions

BUGS:
[] cannot decrease fire cool down without causing a concurrency modification error. bullets get removed faster than loaded.
[] first enemy that collides with a bullet doesnt immediately get removed.
Future refactor thoughts:
[] check how long the player has not detected the current enemy it is suppose to see. if enemy not seen for X number of seconds, remove from linkedlist and replace with new incoming enemy
[] object collision function should be part of object controller class, not object model.
